Despite the alarming increase in job losses across these sectors, Van Reenen is hopeful that they are temporary. “The U.S. economy has been quite resilient compared to expectations. The labor markets held up reasonably well and inflation is coming down much faster in the U.S. than it is in Europe,” he says.

But stability remains uncertain due to global factors, he says, noting the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and China’s influence over the supply chain—especially as the nation battles mounting COVID-19 cases and a lack of medication.

As for the blows technology firms have incurred, Van Reenen believes that in the long run, “the whole world economy is becoming more high-tech and using more AI so the long term prospects of companies like Alphabet are optimistic. But in the short term there’s gonna be bumps on that road.”

## Comments
The tech layoffs have certainly been big news, and it's affected many of my friends who are currently searching for software development jobs, but a large portion of these layoffs (at least with tech companies like Google/Alphabet) actually are coming from non-tech roles, such as recruiting or HR. Though I was a little surprised to see Goldman Sachs also making large cuts, but given how the markets have been lately, perhaps I shouldn't be. Overall however, I think the tech industry is going to be just fine, these layoffs are just indicative of companies stabilizing after aggressively taking advantage of the pandemic. -JoJo Yang (jojo1042)
